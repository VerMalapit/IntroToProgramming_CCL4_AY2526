# Assessment 2 - Utility-App

Your task is to create a Vending Machine program using the Python programming language. The program should demonstrate your knowledge of programming and make use of the techniques introduced over the course of the module. Your application should be accompanied by a development document (1,000 - 1,500 words).

The Application
The Vending Machine must have the following features as a minimum requirement:
● A menu of drinks and snacks presented via the console. The number and range of items is up to you.
● A set of numbers or codes that the user can input to select a particular drink or snack.
● A way of managing money so the user can input any amount of money and have the correct change returned.
● A message that tells the user that a particular drink or snack has been dispensed.
● A message that tells the user how much change they have received.
● Comments in the code to explain key operations.

You may wish to add additional features to your Vending Machine to achieve higher marks. Below is an indication of some of these features, however you may also wish to come up with your own:

● A method of categorising items in the vending machine to improve the user experience (e.g. ‘Chocolate’ or ‘Hot Drinks’).
● A way of allowing users to buy additional items.
● Appropriate error checking to validate inputs and ensure the user has enough money
● An intelligence system for suggesting purchases. For example, if you buy a coffee, the vending machine may suggest that you buy biscuits.
● A stock system meaning the machine may run out of products

The Development Document
Your Vending Machine Python program must be accompanied by a Development Document of 1,000 - 1,500 words. Please include the following elements (note the suggested word counts):
● Specification: A short explanation of what you have been asked to build and a list of features that your vending machine includes. This section should also include a link to your GitHub repository. (100 words)
● System Flowchart: A visual depiction of the logical operation of your Vending Machine. This should be accompanied by a short explanation (50 words).
● Technical Description & Walkthrough: For this section you should provide a video which includes a walkthrough of your program running as well as a technical breakdown of your code. This technical breakdown should explain how the key features of your program have been implemented via code. The video technical description & walkthrough contributes to the overall word count at approx. 100 words per minute. The anticipated length of the video should be between 5 - 8 minutes, anything longer than 10minutes will not be reviewed and may result in a mark penalty. (500 - 800 words)
● Critical Reflection: This should describe what aspects of your Vending Machine you find compelling, what could be improved, and what programming skills you need to learn to make such improvements. (250 words)
● Appendix: A copy of your code should be included in an appendix at the end of your documentation. (Not included in word count)
